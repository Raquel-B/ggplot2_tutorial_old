# Load data and assign Dataset

```{r load_data}
chic <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Z3tt/R-Tutorials/master/ggplot2/chicago-nmmaps.csv")

tibble::glimpse(chic)
```

```{r head}
head(chic,10)
```

# A Default ggplot
##library(ggplot2)

```{r tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

We specify the data outside `aes()` and add the variables that ggplot maps the aesthetics to inside `aes()`

## 1st: We map the variable date to the x position and temp to the y position
```{r maptemp}
(g <- ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)))
```

## 2nd: Now we need to provide geometry, so that ggplot knows how we want to plot that data!

### geom_point() to create a scatter plot:
```{r geompoint}
# geom_point() to create a scatter plot:
g + geom_point()
```

### `geom_line()` to create a line plot (not optimal though):

```{r geomline}
# geom_line() to create a line plot (not optimal though):
g + geom_line()
```

### combine both:

```{r geompointandline}
# combine both:
g + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

## 3rd: Change Properties of Geometries

Within the `geom_*` , you can manipulate visual aesthetics such as the color, shape, and size of your points

```{r geompoint_colour_shape_size}
g + geom_point(color = "firebrick", shape = "diamond", size = 2)
```
Each geom comes with its own properties (called arguments) and the same argument may result in a different change depending on the geom you are using.

```{r geomline_colour_shape_size}
g + geom_point(color = "firebrick", shape = "diamond", size = 2) +
    geom_line(color = "firebrick", linetype = "dotted", size = .3)
```


## 4th: Replace the default ggplot2 theme

And to illustrate some more of ggplot’s versatility, let’s get rid of the grayish default {ggplot2} look by setting a different built-in theme, e.g. `theme_bw()` —by calling `theme_set()` all following plots will have the same black’n’white theme. The red points look way better now!

```{r set_theme}
theme_set(theme_bw())

g + geom_point(color = "firebrick")
```

`theme()` is an essential command to manually modify all kinds of theme elements (texts, rectangles, and lines).

# Working with Axes

## Change Axis Titles

the `labs()` command provides a character string for each label we want to change (here x and y):

```{r axis}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (ºF)")
```

** 💁 You can also add each axis title via `xlab()` and `ylab()`** Example:
```{r axis2}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Temperature (ºF")
```

The code below also allows to add not only symbols but e.g. superscripts (with the use of `^`):

```{r axis_superscripts}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = expression(paste("Temperature (", degree ~ F, ")"^"(Hey, why should we use metric units?!)")))
```

## Increase Space between Axis and Axis Titles

We can change the properties of all or particular text elements (here axis titles) by overwriting the default `element_text()` within the `theme()` call:

```{r axis3}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = 0, size = 15),
        axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2, size = 15))
```

the `vjust` command refers to the vertical alignment, which usually ranges between 0 and 1, **but you can also specify values outside that range**

- `vjust` (which is correct form the label’s perspective)

- but you can also change the distance by specifying the margin of both text elements:

```{r margindistance}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10), size = 15),
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10), size = 15))
```

The labels **t** and **r** within the margin() object refer to **top** and **right**

- You can also specify the four margins as margin (t, r, b, l). Note that we now have to change the right margin to modify the space on the y axis, not the bottom margin.

💡 A good way to remember the order of the margin sides is “t-r-oub-l-e”.

## Change Aesthetics of Axis Titles
Within the e`lement_text()` we can for example overwrite the defaults for size, color, and face:

```{r element_text}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) + 
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (ºF)") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 15, color = "firebrick", face = "italic"))
```

The `face` argument can be used to make the font `bold` or `italic` or even `bold.italic`.

```{r face}
ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp)) +
  geom_point(color = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature (°F)") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color = "sienna", size = 15),
        axis.title.y = element_text(color = "orangered", size = 15))
```
